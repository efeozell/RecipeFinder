# RecipeFinder App

The main purpose of this project was to improve myself and gain hands-on experience.
Of course, creating quality work and presenting something valuable to others in the most professional way possible is one of my biggest goals.
However, this particular project was more focused on practicing and learning rather than serving a real-world need.

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of how to use Axios and how to integrate React Router DOM effectively.
I also reinforced my knowledge of React Hooks, both in writing and using them in practice.

I made some mistakes along the way â€” at one point, I spent almost 30 minutes debugging due to a simple typo.
But I kept going, and eventually achieved my goal.
